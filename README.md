# stagit

This is my fork of [stagit](https://codemadness.org/git/stagit/), tailored for
[my website](https://rob.stumb.org/)

It uses the [MD4C library](https://github.com/mity/md4c) to parse markdown
READMEs into HTML and display an about page for each repo, similar to GitHub
and other git repository web interfaces.
